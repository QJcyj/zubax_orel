\chapter{Overview}

Zubax Orel 20 is an advanced controller of sensorless BLDC motors designed for use in
cost sensitive applications.
Its primary application domains include propulsion systems of electric unmanned aircraft
and watercraft.

Zubax Orel 20 runs Sapog - an open source multiplatform BLDC controller firmware
developed by Zubax Robotics.
Please refer to the Sapog Reference Manual\footnote{Available from the Zubax Robotics website.}
for its usage information.
This datasheet is focused only on the hardware aspect of the product.

\section{System integration}

Zubax Orel 20 is a single supply device, which means that the device does
not require any supply inputs except for the high power supply.
The 5 V rails of the CAN interfaces are not used by the device; rather,
they connect the 5 V rails of their respective CAN connector pairs directly together.

Application-specific integration documentation is available on the Zubax Robotics website.

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{can_daisy_chain}
	\caption{Connection of CAN nodes in non-redundant and doubly redundant CAN bus configurations.
	\label{can_daisy_chain_non_redundant}}
\end{figure}

\section{Quality assurance}

Every manufactured Zubax Orel 20 undergoes an automated testing procedure that validates that
the device is functioning as designed.
The test log for every manufactured device is available on the web at
\url{https://device.zubax.com/device_info}.
This feature can be used to facilitate traceability of purchased devices and
provide additional safety assurances.

Besides testing, every manufactured device has a digital signature installed,
that can be used as a strong protection against unlicensed or counterfeit manufacturing.
Please refer to the dedicated documents or contact Zubax Robotics to find out
the specifics about digital signature verification.

\section{Enclosure}\label{sec:enclosure}

Zubax Orel 20 is intended for integration into the end system in the form of the bare PCB,
as this facilitates better heat dissipation, lower weight and tighter arrangement of components
in the end device, all of which are desirable properties in the target application domains.

Shall it be desired to provide additional mechanical protection for the device,
the plastic enclosure pictured on the figure \ref{enclosure} can be used.
Please contact your supplier for the ordering information;
alternatively, visit \url{https://github.com/Zubax/zubax_orel} to download
3D printable enclosure models suitable for in-house manufacturing.

\end{ZubaxTableWrapper}

\subsection{Regenerative braking}

During regenerative braking, the device performs energy transfer from the motor to the power supply network.
If the self resistance of the power supply network is not sufficiently low,
the regenerative energy transfer may lead to increase of the supply voltage beyond
the safe operating limits.
This event will trigger activation of the transient voltage suppression (TVS) circuit,
which will absorb some of the excessive energy.
If the amount of recovered energy exceeds the absorption capabilities of the power supply
network and the TVS circuit, the device may incur fatal damage.

Generally, batteries are capable of absorbing the regenerated energy during braking without issues.
Problems may arise if the device is powered from a source that does not permit reverse currents,
such as laboratory power supplies.
In the latter case it is advised to install additional buffer capacitors to act as an energy buffer
during braking.

\subsection{Power connectors}

Zubax Orel 20 is equipped with bullet 3.5 mm power connectors.
Input power is provided via male connectors soldered on 100 mm long 16 AWG wires.
The motor phases are connected via female connectors soldered on 100 mm long 16 AWG wires.
Additional connection options are available upon request.

\section{Communication interfaces}

\subsection{CAN bus}

The device is equipped with doubly redundant CAN 2.0A/B interface.
Each CAN interface has two standard UAVCAN Micro connectors\footnote{Refer to
\url{http://uavcan.org} for more information on UAVCAN.}
joined in parallel.
The power rails of the connector pairs are not connected to the device's internal circuitry,
since Zubax Orel 20 does not consume or provide power to the CAN bus.

The device does not terminate the CAN bus internally.

CAN2 (the secondary CAN bus interface) can only be used in configurations with redundant CAN bus.
If the bus is not redundant, only CAN1 (the primary CAN bus interface) can be used.
Connectors of unused CAN bus interfaces should be left empty.

\begin{ZubaxSimpleTable}{CAN bus connectors pinout}{|c X X X[3]|}
	Pin no. & Type         & Name      & Comment \\
	1       & Power        & PWR       & Not connected to the device's circuits internally.\\

	\begin{tablenotes}
	    \item [1] The limit is imposed by the PCB.
	\end{tablenotes}
\end{ZubaxTableWrapper}

\subsection{DroneCode debug port}

The device features a DroneCode debug port available via the standard
DroneCode Mini debug connector (DCD-M)\footnote{Refer to the DroneCode documentation
for more information on standard connectors and communication interfaces.}.
The DroneCode debug port provides access to the device's CLI\footnote{Command line interface.}
via UART, and to the RCPWM input which is shared with the UART RX line.

UART and RCPWM \emph{must not be used simultaneously}.
If RCPWM is activated, it is \emph{prohibited} to connect UART,
as that may cause unpredictable behavior of the RCPWM interface.

\begin{ZubaxSimpleTable}{DroneCode Mini debug connector pinout}{|c X X X|}
	Pin no. & Type         & Name                & Comment \\
	1       & Power        & TPWR                & 3.3 V power output \\
	2       & Output       & UART TX             & \\
	3       & Input        & UART RX \& RCPWM RX & Pulled down with a resistor\\
	4       & Input/Output & SWDIO               & Not for production use \\
	5       & Input        & SWDCLK              & Not for production use \\
	6       & Ground       & GND                 & \\
\end{ZubaxSimpleTable}

\begin{ZubaxSimpleTable}{DroneCode debug port characteristics}{|c X|c c c|c|}

	        & Connector resistance during device lifetime &    & 20   & 40   & $\text{m}\Omega$\\
\end{ZubaxSimpleTable}

\subsection{RCPWM input}

The RCPWM interface has a dedicated connection point near the edge of the PCB,
suitable for soldering wires directly to it.
This connection point is connected directly to the UART RX / RCPWM RX pin,
and so it does not constitute an independent interface.
Same conditions and limitations apply.

\section{Indication}

Zubax Orel 20 is equipped with a single RGB LED indicator for purposes of status indication.
The LED is located on the bottom side near the edge of the PCB.

\section{Mechanical characteristics}

The drawing \ref{drawing} documents the basic mechanical characteristics of Zubax Orel 20,
such as the placement of connectors and mounting holes.

Both connectors of the primary CAN interface are located on the top side of the board.
They are explicitly marked as \verb|CAN1| on the PCB silkscreen.
Connectors of the secondary CAN interface are located on the bottom side of the board,
and marked \verb|CAN2|.

For reference, the red (positive) power supply wire is connected to the top side of the board.
